#' Effects of nitrogen, phosphorus and potasium on lettuce seedlings
#' 
#' The Lettuce dataset contains data from an experiment growing lettuce seedings. There are three treatment factors: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potash (K). It was arranged in three replicates, each containing three blocks, and a different set of contrasts of the N:P:K interaction was confounded with blocks within each replicate.
