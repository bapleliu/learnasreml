#' Lattice design for a variety trial of soybeans
#' 
#' This partially balanced lattice design can be used to illustrate the use of pseudo-factors in msanova. It has a single treatment factor, variety of soybeans, with number of levels equal to the square of an integer k; here k=5. To form the design, this factor is arbitrarily represented as the factorial combinations of two pseudo-factors, here called A and B, each with k levels. A is confounded in the first replicate, and B is confounded in the second replicate. The response variable is the yield.
